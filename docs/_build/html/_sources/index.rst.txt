stLearn - a downstream analysis toolkit for Spatial Transcriptomics data
============================================================================

stLearn is specifically design for Spatial Transcriptomics data. Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) is an emerging technology that adds  spatial dimension and tissue morphology to the genome-wide transcriptional profile of cells in intact tissue. Integrating three types of data creates a vast potential for deciphering novel biology of cell types in their native morphological context. We have developed novel integrative analysis approaches to utilize all three data types to first find cell types, then scan for cell-to-cell interactions and reconstruct cell-type evolution within a tissue.

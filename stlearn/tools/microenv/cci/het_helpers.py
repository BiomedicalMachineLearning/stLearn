                                        per row.

        neighbourhood_bcs: List         List of lists, inner list for each \
                                        spot. First element of inner list is \
                                        spot barcode, second element is array \
                                        of neighbourhood spot barcodes.

        neighbourhood_indices: List     Same structure as neighbourhood_bcs, \
                                        but first inner list element is index \
                                        of the spot, and second is array of \
                                        neighbour indices.

        spot_indices: np.array          Array of indices indicating which spots \
                                        we want edges associated with. Can be \

                                        applied on cell_data, and thereby allows \
